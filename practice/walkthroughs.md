# Walkthroughs for Machine Learning Interview Practice

This document provides a structured approach to various machine learning concepts and problems that are commonly encountered during interviews. Each section includes a brief overview, key points, and example problems to practice.

## 1. Understanding the Basics

### Key Concepts
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction with the environment.

### Example Problem
- Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning with examples.

## 2. Algorithms and Techniques

### Key Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting a continuous outcome.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicting binary outcomes.
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model for decisions.
- **Support Vector Machines**: Finding the hyperplane that best separates classes.

### Example Problem
- Describe how a decision tree algorithm works and its advantages and disadvantages.

## 3. Model Evaluation

### Key Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision and Recall**: Measures of relevance in classification.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

### Example Problem
- How would you evaluate a classification model? Discuss the importance of precision and recall.

## 4. Feature Engineering

### Techniques
- **Normalization and Standardization**: Scaling features for better performance.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into a numerical format.
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing the most relevant features for the model.

### Example Problem
- Explain the process of feature selection and its impact on model performance.

## 5. Advanced Topics

### Concepts
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve performance (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.

### Example Problem
- What are ensemble methods, and how do they improve model accuracy?

## 6. Coding Challenges

### Common Coding Problems
- Implement a linear regression model from scratch.
- Write a function to calculate precision and recall.
- Create a decision tree classifier using a dataset.

### Example Problem
- Given a dataset, implement a function to perform k-fold cross-validation.
