# Challenge Problems for Machine Learning Interviews

This document contains a collection of challenge problems designed to test your understanding of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. These problems are suitable for preparing for interviews for roles such as Data Scientist, ML Engineer, and Generative AI Specialist.

## Problem 1: Predicting House Prices

**Description:** Given a dataset containing various features of houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location), build a regression model to predict house prices.

**Requirements:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.
- Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
- Implement feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
- Compare at least three different regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).

## Problem 2: Image Classification

**Description:** Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Requirements:**
- Preprocess the images (normalization, augmentation).
- Design and implement a CNN architecture.
- Train the model and monitor its performance using validation data.
- Apply techniques to prevent overfitting (e.g., dropout, data augmentation).
- Report the model's accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Problem 3: Customer Segmentation

**Description:** Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

**Requirements:**
- Analyze the dataset to identify relevant features for clustering.
- Implement at least two clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow method or Silhouette score.
- Visualize the clusters and interpret the results.

## Problem 4: Time Series Forecasting

**Description:** Forecast future sales for a retail store using historical sales data.

**Requirements:**
- Perform time series decomposition to analyze trends and seasonality.
- Implement forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing).
- Evaluate the models using metrics such as MAE and MAPE.
- Visualize the forecasted results against actual sales.

## Problem 5: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Description:** Build a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

**Requirements:**
- Preprocess the text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Implement a bag-of-words or TF-IDF representation of the text.
- Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or a simple neural network).
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tips for Solving Challenge Problems

- **Understand the Problem:** Take time to read and understand the problem statement before jumping into coding.
- **Plan Your Approach:** Outline your approach, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
- **Document Your Work:** Keep notes on your thought process, decisions made, and any challenges encountered.
- **Practice Regularly:** Consistent practice with a variety of problems will improve your problem-solving skills and confidence.

## Conclusion

These challenge problems are designed to enhance your understanding of machine learning concepts and prepare you for technical interviews. Make sure to practice these problems thoroughly and seek feedback on your solutions to improve further.
