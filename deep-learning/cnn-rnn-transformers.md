# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of deep neural networks primarily used for processing structured grid data such as images. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

### Key Components
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply convolution operations to the input, using filters to extract features.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input volume, helping to decrease the number of parameters and computation in the network.
- **Activation Functions**: Commonly used functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), which introduces non-linearity into the model.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, typically used at the end of the network for classification tasks.

### Applications
- Image classification (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet)
- Object detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
- Image segmentation (e.g., U-Net)

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

### Overview
Recurrent Neural Networks are designed for sequential data, allowing information to persist. They are particularly effective for tasks where context and order matter, such as time series analysis and natural language processing.

### Key Components
- **Recurrent Layers**: Maintain a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs in the sequence.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A type of RNN that mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for learning long-term dependencies.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)**: A simpler alternative to LSTMs that also addresses the vanishing gradient problem.

### Applications
- Language modeling and text generation
- Sentiment analysis
- Time series forecasting

## Transformers

### Overview
Transformers are a type of model architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms, allowing for the processing of sequences in parallel rather than sequentially. This architecture has revolutionized natural language processing and is increasingly being applied to other domains.

### Key Components
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Computes a representation of the input sequence by weighing the importance of different words relative to each other.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of words in the sequence, as transformers do not inherently understand order.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

### Applications
- Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
- Text summarization
- Question answering systems
