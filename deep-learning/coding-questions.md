# Coding Questions in Deep Learning

This document contains a collection of coding questions that are commonly asked in interviews for roles related to Deep Learning. Each question is designed to test your understanding of deep learning concepts, your coding skills, and your ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems.

## 1. Implement a Neural Network from Scratch

**Question:** Write a Python function to implement a simple feedforward neural network from scratch. The network should include the following features:
- Input layer
- One hidden layer with ReLU activation
- Output layer with softmax activation
- Backpropagation for training

**Expected Skills:** Understanding of neural network architecture, activation functions, and backpropagation.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

**Question:** Using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch), implement a CNN for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Include the following:
- Data preprocessing steps
- Model architecture
- Training loop with validation
- Evaluation metrics

**Expected Skills:** Familiarity with CNNs, image data handling, and model evaluation.

## 3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Sequence Prediction

**Question:** Implement an RNN to predict the next character in a given string. The implementation should include:
- Data preparation (one-hot encoding)
- RNN architecture
- Training process
- Prediction function

**Expected Skills:** Understanding of RNNs, sequence data, and character-level predictions.

## 4. Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models

**Question:** Demonstrate how to use a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for a new classification task. Include:
- Loading the pre-trained model
- Modifying the final layers for the new task
- Training the model on a small dataset

**Expected Skills:** Knowledge of transfer learning, model modification, and fine-tuning.

## 5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Question:** Write a Python implementation of a simple GAN to generate images. The implementation should cover:
- Generator and discriminator architecture
- Training loop
- Loss functions

**Expected Skills:** Understanding of GANs, adversarial training, and image generation.

## 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

**Question:** Describe how you would approach hyperparameter tuning for a deep learning model. Include:
- Techniques (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization)
- Tools and libraries that can assist in hyperparameter tuning

**Expected Skills:** Knowledge of hyperparameter tuning strategies and relevant tools.

## 7. Explain the Vanishing Gradient Problem

**Question:** What is the vanishing gradient problem? How does it affect the training of deep neural networks? Provide solutions to mitigate this issue.

**Expected Skills:** Understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and techniques like batch normalization and using activation functions like ReLU.

## Conclusion

These coding questions are designed to help you prepare for deep learning interviews. Make sure to practice coding these solutions and understand the underlying concepts thoroughly.
