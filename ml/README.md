# Machine Learning Interview Notes

This repository contains comprehensive notes and resources focused on Machine Learning (ML) concepts, algorithms, and interview preparation. It is designed for individuals preparing for roles such as Data Scientist, ML Engineer, and Generative AI Specialist.

## Structure

The project is organized into several key sections:

- **ml/**: Contains in-depth notes on Machine Learning fundamentals, algorithms, theory, model evaluation, feature engineering, and coding questions.
- **deep-learning/**: Focuses on deep learning architectures, training techniques, optimization, and coding questions.
- **generative-ai/**: Covers topics related to generative AI, including transformers, diffusion models, and evaluation methods.
- **data-science/**: Provides insights into statistics, data wrangling, end-to-end ML workflows, and data visualization.
- **interview-tips/**: Offers guidance on behavioral interviews, system design for ML, resume building, and mock interview strategies.
- **faqs/**: Addresses common questions and provides a cheatsheet for quick reference.
- **practice/**: Includes challenge problems, walkthroughs, and datasets for hands-on practice.
- **cheatsheets/**: Contains quick reference materials for math formulas, Python snippets, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **resources/**: Lists recommended books, courses, and reference implementations for further learning.
- **templates/**: Provides templates for study plans, interview checklists, and presentation slides.

## Usage
