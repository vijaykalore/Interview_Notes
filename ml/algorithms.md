# Machine Learning Algorithms

This document provides an overview of key machine learning algorithms, categorized by their learning paradigms. Each algorithm is described with its purpose, strengths, weaknesses, and typical use cases.

## Supervised Learning

### 1. Linear Regression
- **Purpose**: Predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Strengths**: Simple to implement and interpret; works well with linearly separable data.
- **Weaknesses**: Sensitive to outliers; assumes a linear relationship.
- **Use Cases**: House price prediction, sales forecasting.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- **Purpose**: Predict binary outcomes based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Strengths**: Easy to implement; provides probabilities for class membership.
- **Weaknesses**: Assumes linearity between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.
- **Use Cases**: Email spam detection, disease diagnosis.

### 3. Decision Trees
- **Purpose**: Classify data by splitting it into subsets based on feature values.
- **Strengths**: Easy to interpret; handles both numerical and categorical data.
- **Weaknesses**: Prone to overfitting; sensitive to small changes in data.
- **Use Cases**: Customer segmentation, risk assessment.

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Purpose**: Find the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.
- **Strengths**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces; robust against overfitting.
- **Weaknesses**: Memory-intensive; less effective on very large datasets.
- **Use Cases**: Image classification, text categorization.

### 5. Random Forest
- **Purpose**: Ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
- **Strengths**: Reduces overfitting; handles missing values well.
- **Weaknesses**: Less interpretable than single decision trees; can be computationally expensive.
- **Use Cases**: Fraud detection, stock market prediction.

## Unsupervised Learning

### 1. K-Means Clustering
- **Purpose**: Partition data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Strengths**: Simple and efficient; works well with large datasets.
- **Weaknesses**: Requires specifying the number of clusters; sensitive to outliers.
- **Use Cases**: Market segmentation, social network analysis.

### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
- **Purpose**: Build a hierarchy of clusters either agglomeratively or divisively.
- **Strengths**: Does not require a predefined number of clusters; provides a dendrogram for visualization.
- **Weaknesses**: Computationally expensive for large datasets; sensitive to noise.
- **Use Cases**: Gene expression analysis, document clustering.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Purpose**: Reduce dimensionality of data while preserving variance.
- **Strengths**: Helps visualize high-dimensional data; reduces noise.
- **Weaknesses**: Linear method; may not capture complex relationships.
- **Use Cases**: Image compression, exploratory data analysis.

## Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Q-Learning
- **Purpose**: Learn the value of actions in a given state to maximize cumulative reward.
- **Strengths**: Model-free; can handle problems with stochastic transitions.
- **Weaknesses**: Requires a lot of data; convergence can be slow.
- **Use Cases**: Game playing, robotics.

### 2. Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- **Purpose**: Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
- **Strengths**: Capable of learning from raw pixel data; effective in complex environments.
- **Weaknesses**: Requires significant computational resources; can be unstable.
- **Use Cases**: Video game AI, autonomous driving.
