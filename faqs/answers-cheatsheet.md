# Answers Cheatsheet for Machine Learning Interviews

This document serves as a quick reference for common questions and their concise answers related to Machine Learning. It is designed to help candidates prepare for interviews by providing clear and succinct explanations of key concepts.

## Common Questions and Answers

### 1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- **Supervised Learning**: Involves training a model on labeled data, where the output is known. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on this labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The model tries to learn the underlying structure or distribution in the data.

### 2. What is overfitting and how can it be prevented?
- **Overfitting**: Occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers, which negatively impacts its performance on unseen data.
- **Prevention Techniques**:
  - Cross-validation
  - Regularization (L1, L2)
  - Pruning (for decision trees)
  - Early stopping during training
  - Using simpler models

### 3. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.
- **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting).
- **Variance**: Error due to excessive complexity in the learning algorithm. High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data (overfitting).
- The tradeoff is about finding a balance between bias and variance to minimize total error.

### 4. What are precision and recall?
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It measures the accuracy of the positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. It measures the ability of the model to find all the relevant cases.

### 5. What is a confusion matrix?
- A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

### 6. What is cross-validation?
- Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the data into subsets, training the model on some subsets and validating it on others.

### 7. What are hyperparameters and how do they differ from parameters?
- **Parameters**: Internal variables of the model that are learned from the training data (e.g., weights in a neural network).
- **Hyperparameters**: External configurations set before the training process begins (e.g., learning rate, number of trees in a random forest).

### 8. What is feature engineering?
- Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to select, modify, or create features that make machine learning algorithms work better. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance.

### 9. Explain the concept of a ROC curve.
- A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation of a classifier's performance across different threshold values. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, helping to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

### 10. What is the purpose of a learning rate in training models?
- The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. A small learning rate may lead to a long training process, while a large learning rate may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution.
